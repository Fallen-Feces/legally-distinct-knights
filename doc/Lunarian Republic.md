The Lunarian Republic was a short-lived nation state formed on the [[Moon]]. As fears of war with [[Amphibian Empire|the empire]] grew, many [[Lunarian|lunarians]] became proponents of centralisation and militarisation. Although the republic was formed and did have a significant military, it ultimately lost the [[Amphibilunarian War]].
