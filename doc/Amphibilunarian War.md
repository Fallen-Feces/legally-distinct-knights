The **Amphibilunarian War** was a conflict between [[Amphibian Empire]] and [[Lunarian Republic]] during the [[Timeline#Amphibian Empire Era|Amphibian Empire Era]]. It was preceded by the [[Ascendant Genocide]]. It left multiple civilisations in ruin. Extensive use of [[tower|towers]] wrecked havoc on the land-living [[therian]] population of [[Planet Placeholdername]] through tsunamis and and the arms themselves decimated the [[Lunarian|lunarians]] of the [[moon]]. The war was brought to an end by the [[Amphibian Civil War]] and the collapse of the empire.
