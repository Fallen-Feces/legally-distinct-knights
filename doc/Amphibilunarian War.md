The Amphibilunarian War was a conflict between [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and [[Lunarian|lunarians]] sometime in the long-forgotten past. The cause of the war is unknown, but it left both civilisations in near ruin and the extensive use of [[Tower]] wrecked havoc on the land-living [[Therian]] population of [[Planet Placeholdername]].
