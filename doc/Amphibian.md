**Amphibians** are one of the [[Race|races]] inhabiting [[Planet Placeholdername]]. They live [[Placeholdername Sea|under the water]] and were once a highly advanced society, but were brought to the brink of destruction by [[Amphibian Civil War]] at the tail end of the [[Amphibilunarian War]]. They are the original creators of most [[Tower|towers]], but no longer possess the skills to operate them.

Amphibians speak the [[common tongue]]. As such, they enjoy cultural exchange with [[therian|therians]]. Their traditional music genres include Liquid DnB.
