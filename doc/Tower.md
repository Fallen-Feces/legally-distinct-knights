A tower is a massive structure risen out of the sea. Towers are primarily the remnants of the [[Amphibilunarian War]]. They were arms once used by the [[Amphibian|amphibians]] to attack the [[Moon]]. Most towers act as laser or missile canons. However, some towers are rockets that can be launched to the moon. The knowledge of how to operate the towers is long gone to all.

Towers serve as the primary dungeons of the game. They are entered at sea level and are frequently scaled from within by daring adventurers. Their mysterious interiors twist and turn, meaning that each ascent is unlike the last.
