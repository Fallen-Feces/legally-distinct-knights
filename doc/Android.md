**Androids** are the [[Race|humanoid]] [[Construct|constructs]] created by [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and [[Lunarian|lunarians]]. They were produced until and during the [[Amphibilunarian War]]. Most units created before the war were designed for service and companionship, but leading up to and during the war, most manufacturing was military.

Due to the destruction of both societies, the technology required to manufacture them was lost. However, their reliable engineering meant that some androids survived until the present day. Android mechanics are considered extremely valued labourers. However, there are very few mechanics because there are very few androids to work on, and with limited labour, mechanics are not eager to take on new apprentices. Most practitioners are more or less guessing as to what they are doing; the more clever among them limit their work to maintenance of intended features to avoid breaking the valuable androids. There are very few actually skilled android hackers who are able to intentionally modify androids.

Android designs vary between amphibians and lunarians. Amphibian androids are Wall-E coded, lunarian androids are EVA-coded. It's a powerful dichotomy.
