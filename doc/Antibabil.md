The **Antibabil** was a [[tower]] that began construction during the [[Amphibilunarian War]]. It was meant to be the vessel by which [[Amphibian Empire|the empire]] would capture the [[moon]] and end the war. However, through guerrilla warfare, its construction was severely delayed and the economic costs of building it ultimately pushed the empire into the [[Amphibian Civil War]], which effectively ended both the empire and the war.
