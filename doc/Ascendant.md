**Ascendants** were the ancestors of [[Lunarian|lunarians]] and the common name for [[rabbit|rabbits]] and [[Mouse|mice]] starting with the [[Ascent]] and continuing until the [[Ascendant Genocide]]. A portion of the ascendants departed for the [[moon]] first in the [[Babil I]] and subsequently in the [[Babil II]].

# Terrestrial ascendants
Although the mice and rabbits remaining on the planet were [[therian]] in nature, they became known as ascendants and through their sustained cultural exchange with the moon and developed into a culture distinct from the rest of therians.

# Lunarian ascendants
The ascendants on the moon started developing into a distinct race, with features of both rabbits and mice and pale fur. At a certain point, they became known distinctly as lunarians. By 5,000 years after the ascent, lunarians and ascendants were considered different races entirely. Due to the changes in the lunarian language and increased self-sustenance of the moon, cultural exchange between therian ascendants and lunarians decreased.

# Genocide
The ascendant genocide effectively ended the unique aspects of terrestrial ascendants and rabbits and mice were once again considered culturally therian. As such, one portion of the ascendant population had become the lunarians and what remained of the other portion became therian again. Ascendants no longer existed.
