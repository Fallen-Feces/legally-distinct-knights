# Babilian Era
Epoch: circa 13,000 years ago
## 250 years before epoch
The first [[tower]], [[Babil I]], a gigantic space ship meant to travel to the [[moon]], begins construction.

## 200 years before epoch
Babil I is finished and consequently launched. It misses the moon and goes into a large orbital path. The fate of its passengers is unknown. Babil I will pass by [[Planet Placeholdername]] roughly every 25,000 years.

## 100 years before Epoch
Construction of [[Babil II]] begins. Construction is slower than that of Babil I due to doubts surrounding the possibility of success.

## 15 years before epoch
Construction of Babil II finishes. It remains without launch due to fears of the vessel failing. Additional research and experiments take place to secure the possibility of a launch.

## Epoch
Babil II launches and successfully reaches the moon. The [[Lunarian Commune]] is established by the [[Ascendant|ascendants]].

## 10 years after epoch
Radio contact is established between the Lunarian Commune and Planet Placeholdername.

## 110 years after epoch
The lunarian ascendants invent [[Longboat|longboats]] to travel the stars and back to Planet Placeholdername. Trade between the planet and the moon begins.

## 5,000 years after epoch
[[Lunarian|Lunarians]] are at this point distinct from ascendants. Their skin is a pale white and their language has evolved into [[Swedish]]. Due to their own self-sustenance and linguistic differences, cultural and material exchange with the planet lessen.

# Amphibian Empire Era
Epoch: circa 2,000 years ago.

## 100 years before epoch
Fascism arises in the amphibian world.

## 80 years before epoch
Fascism turns the amphibian world into a dictatorship, the [[Amphibian Empire]]. Over the coming decade, the [[Ascendant Genocide]] begins.

## 60 years before epoch
In reaction to the ongoing rise of fascism on the planet, the lunarian population forms the [[Lunarian Republic]] for the purpose of militarising. Their isolation from the planet increases.

## 50 years before epoch
[[Captain Evil]] is born.

## 20 years before epoch
The genocide of ascendants in the amphibian world is virtually complete. To sustain the militarism, the Amphibian Empire begins to annex various islands, many considered [[therian]] territories. The Lunarian Republic does not intervene.

## 10 years before epoch
The construction of [[Antibabil]] begins.
## Epoch
The Amphibian Empire, now dominating the entire planet, sets its sights on the moon. The moon is barraged by towers. The [[Amphibilunarian War]] begins.

## 15 years after epoch
The moon has by and large been eliminated. However, securing it fully and taking its resources requires the finishing of Antibabil. Construction is hastened. Captain Evil, overseeing the construction of the tower, is slain in a guerilla longboat raid, further delaying the possible launch date. With no further incomes to be gained from imperialism yet rising costs of the tower construction, the people of the empire are pushed further into poverty. Cracks begin to show in the empire.

## 30 years after epoch
The amphibian empire falls into the [[Amphibian Civil War]]. The empire and the people turn their weapons of war on each other. A majority of the population dies and the empire falls. Antibabil remains unfinished.
