Therians are a humanoid [[race]] occupying [[Planet Placeholdername]]. They live on its islands and travel the [[Placeholdername Sea]]. Therians are bipedal and resemble many of our world's animals.

Most therians speak the [[Common Tongue]]. They have a good amount of cultural exchange with [[amphibian|amphibians]] and lesser cultural exchange with [[lunarian|lunarians]], primarily through barter when these come to visit the planet.
