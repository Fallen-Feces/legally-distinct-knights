The game takes place on the ocean planet [[Planet Placeholdername]]. The sea is inhabited by [[amphibian|amphibians]] and its islands are inhabited by [[Therian|therians]]. There's a few larger islands with settlements, but most islands are very small. The [[Moon]] orbits around [[Planet Placeholdername]] and houses the [[Lunarian|lunarians]] who sometime visit.

One day, mysterious [[Tower]] started rising out of the water. Their rise gave way to tsunamis, causing massive damage to communities built close to the water. People started exploring the towers in search of treasure and scavenging became a common lifestyle.
